###### HOW TO RUN THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK FILES ######

1.) OPEN TERMINAL ON YOUR SYSTEM

2.) TYPE "JUPYTER NOTEBOOK"

3.) ONCE IT LOADS, OPEN THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK FILES SHARED AS .ZIP FILES 

4.) OPEN the .IPYNB FILES IN ORDER, FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING. (CDD_ML_Part_1_Aromatase_Bioactivity_Data_Concised.ipynb -1st
CDD_ML_Part_2_Aromatase_Bioactivity_Data_Concised.ipynb - 2nd and so on)

5.) THE .IPYNB FILES WOULD ALREADY BE LOADED WITH OUTPUT SHOWN FOR RESPECTIVE LINES OF CODE




###### HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION #######

Before following below steps, run the bioactivity_prediction_app.ipynb file first to generate the aromatase_model.pkl and descriptors_output file.

1.) MAKE SURE APP.PY FILE IS DOWNLOADED TO THE DESIGNATED FOLDER
2.) OPEN TERMINAL 
3.) MAKE SURE STREAMLIT LIBRARY IS INSTALLED IN YOUR SYSTEM, YOU CAN USE "pip install streamlit" in terminal to install the file
4.) TYPE "STREAMLIT RUN APP.PY" IN THE DESIGNATED FOLDER 
5.) ONCE THE APPLICATION LOADS, YOU CAN UPLOAD THE EXAMPLE_AROMATASE.TXT FILE TO THE SIDEBAR WHICH SAYS "BROWSE FILES"
6.) THE APPLICATION WILL CALCULATE AND SHOW THE FINAL OUTPUT 





####### OTHER FILES ########

The other .CSV files included in the folder are the files generated in the code, that is there for reference. The code will generate these files, once it is run step by step. 

The logo.png file is used in the application (for homepage).

The aromatase_model.pkl is generated when running the application Jupyter notebook file (bioactivity_prediction_app.ipynb).

The padel.sh file is the software used to calculate the fingerprints and molecular descriptors.
